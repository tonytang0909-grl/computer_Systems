# Abstraction vs implementation

Taking JAVA for example, it's a well encapsulated language, by this I mean you only need to worry about the API, simply what it can do. On the contrary, you don't need to think about the implementation namely how each API is implemented (Using an array or Linkedlist and the implementation details).

For computer systems, we only need to focus on the API or modules' functionality - what it can do and how we can build up a well-defined system using this modules instead of focusing on its detailed implementation. Hence, here we need to learn or browse many well designed systems. To learn from them.
